// Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of 
// n**3 , the cube above will have volume of (nâˆ’1)**3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1**3.

// You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

//Parameter is the total volume of all the cubes
//Returns the number of rows to build the building
//Examples
//findNb(225) --> 5
// findNb(1071225) --> 45
// findNb(91716553919377) --> -1
